# Astronomy glow-ssary!

## Introduction

Here is a list of the main terms commonly used in astronomy. We will try to keep all definitions simple and understandable while linking to trusted definitions on Wikipedia or other encyclopedia if needed.

## List

### Absolute magnitude



### Amazing observation

For most amateur astronomers: capturing a faint fuzzy spot of what could pass for light if it wasn't that washed out.  
For non-astronomer: wondering where they should watch and what to look for!

### Apparent magnitude

The apparent [magnitude](#magnitude) is a number that measure the brightness of an object as seen from Earth. The brighter the object the lower the number (and vice-versa). Negative magnitude is common (the Sun is -26.7 and the Moon is -12.6). 
In astronomy, it is used as a measure of visible light emission as well as UV and infrared emission (for astro-photography).

### Asterism

### Asteroid

### Binary star

### Comet

### Constellation

### Galaxy

### Globular cluster

### Magnitude

Magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an object in a specific spectrum. For example, visible light or infrared.  
In astronomy we use 2 different definitions of magnitude: [absolute magnitude](#absolute-magnitude) and [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude). Why two? Because one is too easy to understand!

More: [Wikipedia: Magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)).

### Meteor

### Nebula

### Open cluster

### Quasar

### Solar system

### Star

### Star cluster

### Sun

### Surface Brightness

The surface brightness is equal to the [magnitude](#magnitude) divided by the apparent size of the object in the sky.  
The bigger the number, the dimmer the object. The brighter the sky (because of light pollution), the more limiting this number is.
