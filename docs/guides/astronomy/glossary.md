# Astronomy glow-ssary!

## Introduction

Here is a list of the main terms commonly used in astronomy. We will try to keep all definitions simple and understandable while linking to trusted definitions on Wikipedia or other encyclopedia if needed.

## List

### Absolute magnitude

The absolute magnitude is the [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of an object seen from 10 [parsecs](#parsec) or 32.6 [light years](#light-year) unobstructed by anything (particularly interstellar gas & dust clouds).

More: [Wikipedia: Absolute magnitude](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude).

### Amazing observation

For most amateur astronomers: capturing a faint fuzzy spot of what could pass for light if it wasn't that washed out.  
For non-astronomers: wondering where they should watch and what to look for!

### Apparent magnitude

The apparent [magnitude](#magnitude) is a number that measure the brightness of an object as seen from Earth. The brighter the object the lower the number (and vice-versa). Negative magnitude is common (the Sun is -26.7 and the Moon is -12.6). 
In astronomy, it is used as a measure of visible light emission as well as UV and infrared emission (for astro-photography).

### Asterism

### Asteroid

### Astronomical unit

### Binary star

### Comet

### Constellation

### Galaxy

### Globular cluster

### Magnitude

Magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an object in a specific spectrum. For example, visible light or infrared.  
In astronomy we use 2 different definitions of magnitude: [absolute magnitude](#absolute-magnitude) and [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude). Why two? Because one is too easy to understand!

### Meteor

### Nebula

### Open cluster

### Parallax

Big word for a very simple concept: this is simply the difference in apparent position of an object depending on the viewer position. Put your finger up at arm's length, close your left eye and look at your finger and see what's exactly behind. Now, without moving close the right eye and open the left eye. Your finger remained in the same position but the background "moved". That's the parallax. In astronomy we tend to use the [Sun](#sun) as a reference point and either our position or an object position in space to define parallax (especially when defining units like a [parsec](#parsec)).

### Parsec

A parsec is a distance unit. It is equal to about 3.26 [light years](#light-year). It is define as the distance from the [Sun](#sun) to an object that as a [parallax](#parallax) angle of 1 arcsecond.

More: [Wikipedia: Parsec](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec).

### Quasar

### Solar system

### Star

### Star cluster

A group of stars usually bound by gravity. Some clusters are 

### Sun

Our good old Sun, the closest star from us.  
The star the Earth is orbiting.

### Surface Brightness

The surface brightness is equal to the [magnitude](#magnitude) divided by the apparent size of the object in the sky.  
The bigger the number, the dimmer the object. The brighter the sky (because of light pollution), the more limiting this number is.
