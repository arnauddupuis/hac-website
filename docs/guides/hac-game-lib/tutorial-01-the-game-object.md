# HAC Tutorial - 01: The Game object

## Introduction

This first tutorial is all about the [Game] object!  
The [Game] object is key to game management. It does **a lot** of things behind your back to keep track of every object you are going to use in your game. 

By the end of these tutorials you will be able to do all that by yourself, but right now it ease the learning curve to rely on some (hopefully) robust pre-existing logic.

## Video

This first tutorial is done under the form of a code along video available on Youtube (a bad one but bear with us, it'll become better over time).
