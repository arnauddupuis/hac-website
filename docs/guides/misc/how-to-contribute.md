# How to contribute

ðŸš§ðŸ‘· **THIS ARTICLE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** ðŸ‘·ðŸš§

## Introduction

This guide is going to walk through the process of making contributions to the Hyrule Astronomy Club website. The principles of pull requests (we'll see more about that in a bit) can be extended to contribute to the hac-game-lib, but I'm going to assume that if you have the capacity to contribute to the hac-game-lib git and github pull requests are not really an issue :wink:.

This website is actually the result of a very straightforward yet organized technology stack and workflows (One more sentence to look smart at dinners!). 
 1. The website code is using the [Vuepress] framework with some [custom made modules](https://github.com/arnauddupuis/hac-website/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/components).
 2. All the code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/arnauddupuis/hac-website).
 3. The compiled website is hosted on [Netlify].
 4. Every time commits are pushed in the master branch, a webhook is triggered for [Netlify] to build the new version of the website.

So all the content of this website is versioned on git. And all pages are actually [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatted files that are converted by [Vuepress] into HTML.

Markdown is extremely simple and straightforward, if you don't know this markup language you can read the excellent [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) from Adam Pritchard.

Now, with all of this in mind,
