# Meet the Deep Sky Objects - Messier 3

## Introduction

First post of our serie Meet the Deep Sky Objects (DSO) on Messier 3 Globular Cluster. We will cover some basics of DSO observation and get details on one specific object in our articles. 

One important point: the list is certainly really long but ours is going to be shorter. The good reason? We will only talk about the objects we have actually oberved and sketched!
