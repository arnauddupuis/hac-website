# Astronomy glow-ssary!

## Introduction

Here is a list of the main terms commonly used in astronomy. We will try to keep all definitions simple and understandable while linking to trusted definitions on Wikipedia or other encyclopedia if needed.

## List

### Absolute magnitude

The absolute magnitude is the [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of an object seen from 10 [parsecs](#parsec) or 32.6 [light years](#light-year) unobstructed by anything (particularly interstellar gas & dust clouds).

More: [Wikipedia: Absolute magnitude](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude).

### Amazing observation

For most amateur astronomers: capturing a faint fuzzy spot of what could pass for light if it wasn't that washed out.  
For non-astronomers: wondering where they should watch and what to look for!

### Apparent magnitude

The apparent [magnitude](#magnitude) is a number that measure the brightness of an object as seen from Earth. The brighter the object the lower the number (and vice-versa). Negative magnitude is common (the Sun is -26.7 and the Moon is -12.6). 
In astronomy, it is used as a measure of visible light emission as well as UV and infrared emission (for astro-photography).

More: [Wikipedia: Apparent magnitude](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude).

### Apoapsis

This is the highest point of an orbit. You ascend to the apoapsis, once you pass it you fall to the [periapsis](#periapsis). Apsis means orbit in Greek.  
If you want to be really technical and look smart at dinners, it is technically the highest distance between the barycenters of 2 orbiting bodies (Earth and a spacecraft for example).

### Astronomical unit

It's a unit of distance (again). This used to be defined as the distance between the [Sun](#sun) and Earth. However, this distance varies with Earth highest and lowest points (respectively aphelion and perihelion).  
In this time and age, vague and non-precise units are not favoured by anyone (*cough* *cough* aside from the 3 countries in the world still using the imperial system of weight and measures...), so an AU (abbreviation for Astronomical Unit) is now defined precisely as 149 597 870 700 metres.

More: [Wikipedia: Astronomical Unit](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit), [Apoapsis](#apoapsis), [Periapsis](#periapsis).

### Light year

It's the distance crossed by the light in one year. Light travels roughly at 300 000 kilometers per second.  
1 light year is equal to 9.46 x 10^12 km (or 5.88 x 10^12 mi).

### Magnitude

Magnitude is a measure of the brightness of an object in a specific spectrum. For example, visible light or infrared.  
In astronomy we use 2 different definitions of magnitude: [absolute magnitude](#absolute-magnitude) and [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude). Why two? Because one is too easy to understand!

More: [Wikipedia: Magnitude](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)).

### Meteorite

A piece of space debris that falls on a planet or moon and survive the passage through the atmosphere. 

When it encounter the atmosphere it transforms into a **meteor** (mostly because of frictions with the atmosphere). A meteor is commonly known as a *shooting star*.

### Nebula

Nice word to say: **cloud**. It's not your typical earth-like cloud, it's a cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and some other gas (mostly ionized by stars or stars remnants).  
Nebula are valuable targets for astronomers as they are mostly beautiful, like the pillars of creation in the Eagle Nebula for example (you need a space telescope to take that kind of photo):

### Open cluster

An open cluster is a group (not more than a few thousands) of [stars](#star) born from the same [star nursery](#star-nursery). They are loosely bound by gravity but this bound is relatively easily disrupted by encounters with other massive objects (like other clusters or gas clouds).

The most well know open cluster is the Pleiades cluster:

### Parallax

Big word for a very simple concept: this is simply the difference in apparent position of an object depending on the viewer position. Put your finger up at arm's length, close your left eye and look at your finger and see what's exactly behind. Now, without moving close the right eye and open the left eye. Your finger remained in the same position but the background "moved". That's the parallax. In astronomy we tend to use the [Sun](#sun) as a reference point and either our position or an object position in space to define parallax (especially when defining units like a [parsec](#parsec)).

### Parsec

A parsec is a distance unit. It is equal to about 3.26 [light years](#light-year). It is define as the distance from the [Sun](#sun) to an object that as a [parallax](#parallax) angle of 1 arcsecond.

More: [Wikipedia: Parsec](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec).

### Periapsis

This is the lowest point of an orbit. You fall to the periapsis, once you pass it you ascend to the [apoapsis](#apoapsis). Apsis still means orbit in Greek.  
If you want to be really technical and look even smarter at dinners, it is technically the lowest distance between the barycenters of 2 orbiting bodies (Earth and the Sun, but in this case we have special names Perigee or Perihelion).

### Quasar

Quasar comes from the contraction of **quasi-stellar** object. They are extremely bright galactic cores, most of the time because of a super-massive black hole coupled with a massive gaseous accretion disk. The gravitational strength generate so much frictions that a single quasar emits a lot of energy: up to a **thousand** times the **total amount** of energy emitted by **our whole galaxy** (The Milky Way)!

There is a lot more to say about quasars, I encourage you to read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar).

### Solar system

Just everything that is gravitationally bound to the [Sun](#sun). That includes the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and not Pluto), Dwarf planets (there you go Pluto, with Makemake, Haumea and the others), comets, asteroids belt, basically everything between the Sun and the outer belt of the [Oort cloud](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud).  
The proposed boundary of the solar system is anywhere between 2 000 [AU](#astronomical-unit) and 200 000 [AU](#astronomical-unit).

Keep in mind that the vast majority of the solar system is still uncharted territory. 

### Star

I just love [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star): A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.

All in all, it's a ball of gas (in a lot of case hydrogen) so gigantic that it crumbles under its own weight and light up nuclear fusion. The only thing preventing it to blow up in a cataclysmic event is its own gravitational pull.  
It also burn tremendous amount of fuel each second, therefor radiating mass as light and heat. _See the problem here?_

In case it was not clear the [Sun](#sun) is a star...

### Star cluster

A group of stars usually bound by gravity. Some clusters just look like clusters from Earth but are not actually pack of stars in space, it's only perspective playing its game.  
Within the _real_ clusters you can find 2 families: the [globular star clusters](#globular-cluster) and the [open star clusters](#open-cluster).

### Star nursery

A Star nursery is a huge interstellar cloud where stars are born. This type of cloud is specific because it is dense and large enough to allow hydrogen to create molecules of hydrogen (H2).  
The molecules of hydrogen locally aggregates and collapse into stars.

### Sun

Our good old Sun, the closest [star](#star) from us.  
The star the Earth is orbiting.

More: [Wikipedia: Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)

### Surface Brightness

The surface brightness is equal to the [magnitude](#magnitude) divided by the apparent size of the object in the sky.  
The bigger the number, the dimmer the object. The brighter the sky (because of light pollution), the more limiting this number is.

## Enhancing the list

This list is far from being exhaustive. Please feel free to suggest improvements either in the comments or even better: opening a [PR on Github](https://github.com/arnauddupuis/hac-website/compare)!
